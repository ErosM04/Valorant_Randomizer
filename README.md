# Valorant_Randomizer
It's for educational purpose, I swear.

## Structure
Look at Site.png.

## Behavior
When the site gets open some buttons magically appear at the center of the screen.
Than you select the number of player, from 2 up to 10, and a number of text fields equivalent to the NoP will appear.
After entering the name of the player (check that all the text fileds are not empty and there aren't duplicates) the game will hide the buttons and generate a title on the top equals to the map randomically choosen and on the background the map image will appear.
Than on the center of the screen the 2 squad will appear splitted in attack and defence and every player will have his box with his own agent.
On the bottom of the page 2 bottoms appears, one for the re-randomiztion of the agents and one for the re-randomiztion of the map.
