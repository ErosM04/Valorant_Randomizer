# Valorant_Randomizer
It's for educational purpose, I swear.

## Structure
Look at Site.png.

## First page
When the site gets open some buttons magically appear at the center of the screen.
Than you select the number of player, from 2 up to 10, and a number of text fields equivalent to the NoP will appear.
After entering the name of the player (check that all the text fileds are not empty and there aren't duplicates), a generate button will appear.
When the botton gets clicked, the game will reload another page.

## Second page
The second page will still have the ``Valorant Randomizer`` title and another title on the top equals to the name of the randomically choosen map and the background image will be the one of the map.
Than on the center of the screen the 2 squad will appear splitted in attack and defence (with colored box) and every player will have his box with his own name match with the agent image.
On the bottom of the page there will be 2 bottons, one for the re-randomization of the agents and one for the re-randomization of the map.
